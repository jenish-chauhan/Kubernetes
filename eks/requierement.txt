after creating an cluster on the EKS you need to create an kubeconfig file to access the cluster

```
aws eks --region us-east-1 update-kubeconfig --name my-cluster
```


this command will create a kubeconfig file in the ~/.kube/config file. you can use this file to access the cluster using kubectl command.

to verify the cluster access you can run the following command

```bash
kubectl get nodes

ps aux | grep kubelet
